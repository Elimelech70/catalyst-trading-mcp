  Purpose: Live day trading operations
  Focus: US markets, Stage 1, rule-based momentum trading
  Timeline: Weeks 1-8 (COMPLETE)
  Status: In progress (95% complete)
  
  Services (9):
    1. Orchestration Service (MCP interface for Claude Desktop)
    2. Workflow Service (REST coordination)
    3. Scanner Service (market scanning)
    4. Pattern Service (chart patterns)
    5. Technical Service (indicators)
    6. Risk Manager Service (validation)
    7. Trading Service (Alpaca execution)
    8. News Service (catalyst detection)
    9. Reporting Service (analytics)
  
  Infrastructure:
    - Single DigitalOcean droplet ($63/month)
    - Managed PostgreSQL database (normalized schema v6.0)
    - Docker Compose orchestration
    - Cron automation (10+ executions/day)
    - Claude Desktop monitoring

RESEARCH INSTANCE (ML & Economic Analysis):
  Purpose: ML experimentation, macro analysis, strategy research
  Focus: Economic indicators, empire transitions, crisis detection
  Timeline: Month 6+ (AFTER Production succeeds)
  Status: Design phase only
  
  Scope (Future):
    - Ray Dalio empire transition framework
    - GFC-style leading indicator tracking
    - ML pattern discovery
    - Multi-market analysis (US, China, Japan)
    - Backtest engine
    - Paper trading sandbox
  
  Infrastructure (Future):
    - Separate DigitalOcean droplet ($186/month)
    - Separate database (research_trading)
    - Multi-agent AI coordination

```

### 1.2 Critical Understanding

**v6.0.0 Milestone**: Clean separation of Production vs Research
- **Before v6.0**: Mixed specifications caused confusion
- **After v6.0**: Separate functional specs allow faster completion
- **v6.1.0**: Added cron automation to Production spec

**Why Separate?**
```yaml
Problem with Mixed Approach:
  - Slowed down Production implementation
  - Created scope creep
  - Violated single responsibility principle
  - Mixed immediate needs with future research

Benefit of Separation:
  - Fast Production completion (focused)
  - Research built incrementally (as Production succeeds)
  - Clear boundaries
  - Independent scaling
```

5. Documentation finalization

### 2.2 Implementation Tasks Remaining

#### **Task 1: Claude Desktop MCP Integration (CRITICAL)**

**Problem**:
```yaml
Current Architecture:
  - Trading system: DigitalOcean droplet (remote)
  - Claude Desktop: Windows 11 laptop (local)
  - MCP protocol: Expects local server communication
  
Challenge:
  - MCP client (Claude Desktop) → needs → MCP server (Orchestration)
  - But Orchestration Service is REMOTE (DigitalOcean)
  - MCP doesn't natively support remote servers
```

**Solution Architecture**:
```yaml
Component 1: NGINX Reverse Proxy (DigitalOcean)
  - Handles SSL termination
  - Routes MCP requests to Orchestration Service (port 5000)
  - WebSocket support for MCP protocol
  
Component 2: Python Proxy Bridge (Windows 11 laptop)
  - Runs locally on laptop
  - Presents as "local" MCP server to Claude Desktop
  - Forwards requests to remote NGINX over HTTPS
  - Handles authentication
  
Component 3: Orchestration Service (existing)
  - No changes needed
  - Already implements FastMCP protocol
  - Listens on port 5000 (Docker network)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
```bash
Step 1: Configure NGINX on DigitalOcean
  - SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
  - Proxy pass to Orchestration Service
  - WebSocket upgrade headers
  
Step 2: Build Python Proxy Bridge
  - fastmcp-proxy.py (local Windows service)
  - Connects to remote NGINX
  - Implements MCP server interface locally
  
Step 3: Update Claude Desktop config.json
  - Point to local proxy (localhost:5000)
  - Proxy forwards to remote system
  
Step 4: Test end-to-end
  - Claude Desktop → Local Proxy → NGINX → Orchestration
  - Verify MCP resource reads
  - Verify MCP tool executions
```

**Timeline**: 2-3 days

### 3.4 Research Instance Implementation Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Build incrementally as Production succeeds

```yaml
Month 1-2: PRODUCTION ONLY
  - Complete Catalyst Trading System
  - Validate trading strategy
  - Collect initial training data
  
Month 3-5: PRODUCTION OPERATION
  - Live trading with human monitoring
  - Refine risk parameters
  - Build track record
  - Accumulate ML training data
  
Month 6+: IF PRODUCTION SUCCEEDS
  - Begin Research instance design
  - Deploy economic intelligence layer
  - Start ML experimentation
  - Expand to multi-market
```

**Success Gates**:
```yaml
Gate 1 (Start Research Design):
  ✅ Production profitable for 3 months
  ✅ Win rate > 50%
  ✅ Average R:R > 2:1
  ✅ No critical system failures
  
Gate 2 (Deploy Research Instance):
  ✅ Research design documents approved
  ✅ Production running autonomously
  ✅ Capital available for 2nd droplet ($136/month)
  ✅ Clear ML research objectives defined
```

## 6. Risk Management

### 6.1 Production Risks

**Risk 1: Claude Desktop MCP Integration Fails**
```yaml
Probability: Medium (30%)
Impact: Medium (system works, but manual oversight harder)
Mitigation:
  - Cron automation already handles all trading
  - Claude Desktop is SECONDARY (monitoring only)
  - System operates autonomously without it
Contingency:
  - Continue with cron automation
  - Manual SSH monitoring via curl commands
  - Revisit MCP integration later
```

**Risk 2: Paper Trading Results Poor**
```yaml
Probability: Low (20%)
Impact: High (delays live trading)
Mitigation:
  - Strategy based on proven Ross Cameron methodology
  - News catalyst filtering adds edge
  - Risk management conservative
Contingency:
  - Extend paper trading period
  - Tune parameters (tighter patterns, better catalysts)
  - Iterate until win rate > 50%
```

**Risk 3: Live Trading Losses**
```yaml
Probability: Medium (40%)
Impact: Low (losses capped at 1% per trade, 5% max drawdown)
Mitigation:
  - Conservative mode (3 positions max, 0.5% risk)
  - Stop losses enforced automatically
  - Emergency stop available (SSH + curl)
Contingency:
  - Return to paper trading
  - Analyze losses (strategy vs execution)
  - Adjust parameters before resuming
```

### 6.2 Research Risks

**Risk 1: Production Never Succeeds**
```yaml
Probability: Low (15%)
Impact: Critical (Research never starts)
Mitigation:
  - Production based on proven methodology
  - Risk management extremely conservative
  - Can iterate on strategy without capital risk (paper trading)
Contingency:
  - Research design documents still valuable
  - Can pivot to different trading strategy
  - Knowledge gained applies to any system
```

**Risk 2: Research Budget Not Available**
```yaml
Probability: Medium (30%)
Impact: Medium (Research delayed)
Mitigation:
  - Research droplet funded by Production profits
  - If Production profitable, budget available
Contingency:
  - Delay Research implementation
  - Start with minimal Research services (Economic Intelligence only)
  - Scale up as Production profits increase
```

**Risk 3: Research Scope Creep**
```yaml
Probability: High (60%)
Impact: Medium (Research completion delayed)
Mitigation:
  - Strict separation from Production
  - Clear design documents (boundaries)
  - Incremental implementation (Phase 1, 2, 3)
Contingency:
  - Focus on core features first (Economic Intelligence)
  - Defer ML pattern discovery if needed
  - Multi-agent AI last priority
```
