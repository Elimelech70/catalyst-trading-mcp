## Risk Considerations

### Data Quality Risks
- **Survivorship Bias:** Historical data may exclude delisted stocks
- **Look-Ahead Bias:** Economic data revisions create false backtesting results
- **Overfitting Risk:** More data sources increase dimensionality curse
- **Signal Decay:** Profitable patterns may disappear as they become known

### Cost Management
- **Budget Creep:** Easy to overspend on exotic data without ROI validation
- **Lock-in Contracts:** Many providers require annual commitments
- **Infrastructure Scaling:** Storage and processing costs grow with data volume
- **Development Overhead:** Custom integration requires ongoing maintenance

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Market Data Agreements:** Professional use may require different licensing
- **Data Redistribution:** Restrictions on sharing processed insights
- **Audit Requirements:** Financial services regulation compliance
- **Privacy Concerns:** Alternative data sources may have usage restrictions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Month 1)
1. **Upgrade to Alpaca Pro** ($99/month) - Highest ROI
2. **Implement enhanced technical analysis** ($200 one-time)
3. **Add basic news integration** ($50/month)

### Phase 2 (Months 2-3)
4. **Add options flow data** ($199/month) when capital allows
5. **Enhance storage infrastructure** ($100/month)
6. **Develop custom pattern recognition** ($2,000 one-time)

### Phase 3 (Months 4-6)
7. **Evaluate Level 2 data** based on Phase 2 results
8. **Consider alternative data sources** only after maximizing basic data
9. **Implement advanced ML infrastructure** when trading capital justifies cost

**Critical Success Factor:** Focus on execution quality and pattern recognition before adding expensive data sources. Many profitable traders succeed with basic data and superior analysis rather than exotic feeds with poor implementation.
