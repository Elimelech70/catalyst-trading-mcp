echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Check if news container is running:"

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Test health endpoint from HOST machine:"
echo "   curl http://localhost:5008/health"
curl -v http://localhost:5008/health 2>&1

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Test health endpoint from INSIDE container:"

echo "5Ô∏è‚É£ Check recent logs from news service:"
docker logs catalyst-news --tail 20
echo ""

echo "6Ô∏è‚É£ Manual health check test:"
echo "   If you can curl from host but health check fails inside container,"
echo "   it means the Dockerfile health check command needs fixing."
echo ""

echo "üí° LIKELY ISSUE:"
echo "   The health check in Dockerfile tries to import requests, but"
echo "   uvicorn might not be fully ready when health check runs."
echo ""
echo "   Solution: Increase start-period in HEALTHCHECK or use curl instead"
